<h1>lwip_contrib - Miscelaneous LWIP Related Code</h1>

<p>This repository contains some code I wrote for LWIP embedded applications that
would likely be useful to others. There are a few independent components
contained herein:</p>

<ul>
<li>mDNS responder</li>
<li>iperf server</li>
<li>Simple Discovery responder</li>
<li>Generic TFTP Server</li>
<li>Zero copy driver for the STM32F2x7 family of devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>These components are described in more detail below. </p>

<h2>apps/mdns</h2>

<p>This application is a very simple mDNS and mDNS-SD responder. It's been tested
to work with avahi and bonjour for windows. An example usage follows.</p>

<pre><code>static const struct mdns_service services[] = {
    {
        .name = "\x06_iperf\x04_tcp\x05local",
        .port = IPERF_SERVER_PORT,
    },
    {
        .name = "\x05_echo\x04_tcp\x05local",
        .port = 7,
    },
};

static const char *txt_records[] = {
    "product=LWIP Example",
    "version=" VERSION,
    NULL
};

mdns_responder_init(&amp;netif, services, sizeof(services) / sizeof(\*services),
                    txt_records);
</code></pre>

<p>With this configuration two services are advertised: one for an iperf server
and one for a tcp echo server. Note: the service names must be specified
similar to how they are sent on the wire. That is each segment (where the dot
would be) is prefixed by single byte with the number of characters that
follow.</p>

<p>The code will also use the hostname set in LWIP for lookups and will respond to
A record requests for the following domains:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>hostname</em>.local</li>
<li><em>mac_address</em>.local    (there are no colons in the mac address, just 12
                      hexadecimal characters)</li>
<li><em>hostname</em>-<em>XX</em>.local  (where XX is the last two hexadecimal digits of the
                      mac address)</li>
<li><em>hostname</em>-<em>mac_address</em>.local</li>
</ol>

<h2>apps/iperf</h2>

<p>This code provides an iperf server compatible with version 2 of the standard
iperf utility. Bi-directional and simultaneous transfers are supported. Some
examples:</p>

<pre><code>$ iperf -c lwip-38.local -r

<h2>apps/simple_discovery</h2>

<p>A very simple UDP broadcast (or multi-cast) based discovery method. This has
probably been implemented a thousand times with different slight variations. A
simple python script is included to do the discovery. </p>

<h2>apps/tftp_server</h2>

<p>This is an implementation of a generic TFTP server. File data is handled
through four user-implemented callback functions: open, close, read and write.</p>

<h2>ports/stm32f2x7</h2>

<p>The example code provided from ST was pretty weak to say the least. It wasn't
zero-copy and had no support for detecting link changes. So I wrote this driver 
from scratch which does the transfer using no copies and only the (very nicely
designed) DMA engine. Link detection is also supported and the appropriate
netif functions are called when the connection changes.</p>

<p>The code is designed to use the Micrel KS8721 PHY. This is the PHY used on the
Olimex STM32-P207 development kit which this code was originally developed for.</p>

<p>The driver will not likely compile as is. It uses a small amount of custom code
for registering and enabling interrupt functions which I have not included. The
user will have to replace this with equivalent functions.</p>

<p>To implement this driver the stif<em>init function must be passed to the netif</em>add
function in the usual way. Then the stif_loop function should be called in the
main loop. It will return 1 if there may be more work to do (in which case
sleeping should be avoided).</p>

<h2>examples/stm32f2x7</h2>

<p>An example project is included which demonstrates much of the above code.
However, it requires some custom library code which I have not included so it
will not build on it's own. It should be at least useful as a reference for how
the GPIO should be setup, etc.</p>
